## DojoKatas

This repositary is a collection of solutions to different short coding Kata's (challenges).
The aim is to collaboratively explore different JS methods and syntax approaches.

## Repo Structure & ways of working

### Adding a Kata

If you want to add a Kata:

1. Create a folder with a short description of the Kata as its name
2. Create a `question.md` file outlining the problem, answer and test cases
3. If possible add a test file for your solution

### Adding a solution

If you want to submit an attempt:

1. Create your own branch
2. Add your solution as a file with your name e.g. `AnishaSolution.js`
3. Raise a PR
4. DO NOT delete your branch, continue to use it for all your contributions

### Reviewing a solution

If you want to review a solution:

1. Add notes as comments in the `Solution.js` file
2. Raise a PR adding the solution owner as a reviewer
