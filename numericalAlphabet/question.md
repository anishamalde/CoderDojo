Given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

`const testString = "The sunset sets at twelve o' clock."`

**Answer:** "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"

`const testArray = "I really love coding challenges!"`

**Answer:** "9 18 5 1 12 12 25 12 15 22 5 3 15 4 9 14 7 3 8 1 12 12 5 14 7 5 19"
