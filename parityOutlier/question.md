You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier"

`const testArray = [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]`

**Answer:** 11

`const testArray = [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]`

**Answer:** 160
